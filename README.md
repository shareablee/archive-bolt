# archive-bolt

Reusable Storm bolt for archiving data to file. Currently supports storing to s3. 

## Usage

Takes a tuple of `["backend", "location", "content"]` where backend is where the content will be stored, location is the path the file should be saved to, and content is a string to be written to file (json).

To use in another project, include the compiled jar generated by `lein uberjar` in the storm classpath.

### Behavior

- Attempts to safely retry storing to the specified backend so the caller does not have to
- Emits a boolean if it was successful
- `acks!` the tuple if successful, `fail!` the tuple if unsuccessful
